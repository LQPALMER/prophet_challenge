# prophet_challenge
This activity will do the following:
 Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic
 Mine the search traffic data for seasonality
 Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns
 Create a time series model with Prophet

 We will determine if the Google search traffic for the company links to any financial events at the company. Or, does the search traffic data just present random noise? To answer this question, I picked out any unusual patterns in the Google search data for the company, and connected them to the corporate financial events.

 If we can track and predict interest in the company and its platform for any time of day, then we can focus their marketing efforts around the times that have the most traffic. This will get a greater return on investment (ROI) from their marketing budget.

We will mine the search traffic data for predictable seasonal patterns of interest in the company. 

Next, we want to know if any relationship between the search data and the company stock price exists.
Now, we will produce a time series model that analyzes and forecasts patterns in the hourly search data.
